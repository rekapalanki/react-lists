A walkthrough of the React Lists tutorial via codeberryschool

Where to put the key? 

Keys help React to identify items. If no keys have been set, by default it will 
be the index. However, if lists can be sorted, the index will be changed and it 
can cause errors. 

A golden rule is that the elements inside the map() function need keys.
